        <p>To achieve our goals we have partnered with Job Corp an aboriginal run college based out of Lac La Biche that specializes in post-secondary education for aboriginal peoples. In Alberta there is a growing need in the workplace for skilled trade`s people. This initiative helps provide Aboriginal peoples with real opportunities to gain long term employment in the trades.</p>

Revitalizing the trade programs at Job Corp will significantly help with setting our aboriginal employees up to succeed. Not only will it teach them the skills of their trade, but it will help them overcome some socioeconomic changes that are associated with being part of a workforce.</p>
